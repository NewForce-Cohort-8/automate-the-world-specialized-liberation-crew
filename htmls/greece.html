            <p>In this place roughly 2,502 years ago, a battle was joined between a mere 300 Spartans facing off against the hordes of the East. The 300 gallantly fought before being betrayed and surrounded, they then fought to the last man.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Anyone can visit the site today. As this is a battlefield site and not a large archaeological site, it won't take long to see and explore the site (no more than 30 minutes). The main attraction is the Memorial of Leonidas and the 300 Spartans, together with a huge bronze statue of King Leonidas.</li>
                <li>The statue stands on a massive stone wall with two marble statues of men representing the river Eurotas and Mount Taygetos. There is also a small museum in the area.</li>

            <p>A bronze statue of Leonidas was erected at Thermopylae in 1955.[19] A sign, under the statue, reads simply: "ΜΟΛΩΝ ΛΑΒΕ" ("Come and take them"), which was Leonidas' laconic reply when Xerxes offered to spare the lives of the Spartans if they gave up their arms.</p>
